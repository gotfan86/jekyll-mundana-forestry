## Famous Scientists And Their Inventions

A scientist is someone who explores the nature of the universe. On the other hand, an investigator is someone who tries to create useful devices and products. A few people have been successful in both endeavours. Given below is a list of discoveries that includes 17 famous scientists and their discoveries.

### Albert Einstein

![Albert Einstein](https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Albert-Einstein.jpg "Albert Einstein")Photon, also known as light quantum, is a tiny energy packet of electromagnetic radiation. This concept originated in Albert Einstein’s explanation of the photoelectric effect, in which he proposed the existence of discrete energy packets during the transmission of light. Albert Einstein was best known for his General and[Special theory of relativity](https://byjus.com/physics/special-theory-of-relativity/)and the concept of mass-energy equivalence (_E_=_mc2_.)

### J.J Thomson

J.J Thomson, an English physicist and a Nobel Laureate in Physics, is credited and honoured with the discovery of the electron, which was the first subatomic particles to be discovered. Thomson managed to show that cathode rays were composed of previously unknown negatively charged particles (electrons), which he calculated and inferred might have smaller bodies than atoms and a substantial charge-mass ratio. He is also credited for finding the first evidence for the existence of isotopes for stable elements.

### Ernest Rutherford

Ernest Rutherford, a Zealand chemist is regarded as the “father of nuclear physics.” He was the first to propose that an atom comprises a small charged nucleus surrounded by empty space and are circled by tiny electrons which later, became known as the Rutherford model. He is credited with the discovery of protons and hypothesized the existence of the neutron.

### John Dalton

John Dalton’s major contribution was his theory on atoms which consists of five parts as follows:

* Atoms are made of tiny particles known as atoms
* Atoms are indivisible and indestructible
* Atoms of a given element are identical in size, mass, and chemical properties
* In a chemical reaction, atoms separate, combine and rearrange

Dalton made a lot of discoveries based on his observations.

### James Chadwick

James Chadwick, a British physicist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1935 for his discovery of the neutron. Bombarding elements with neutron can result in the penetration and splitting of nuclei generating an enormous amount of energy. This way, Chadwick’s findings were pivotal to the discovery of nuclear fission and ultimately, the development of the atomic bomb.

### Isaac Newton

Isaac Newton’s discoveries created a launchpad for future developments in science. His most noteworthy innovations were as follows:

* Newton’s three laws of motion set the foundation for modern classical mechanics.
* The discovery of gravitational force gave us the ability to predict the movement of [heavenly bodies](https://byjus.com/physics/celestial-bodies/).
* His discovery of the calculus gave us a potent mathematical tool, aiding the precise analytical treatment of the physical world.

Isaac Newton is one of the greatest mathematicians and physicists of all time, and his inventions and discoveries widened the reach of human thoughts.
